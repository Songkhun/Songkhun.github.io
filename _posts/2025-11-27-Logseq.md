Note-taking app, finally I found one that I love!

Logseq: https://logseq.com/
======
## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Capture First, Organize Later"
    - Logseq is an outliner. This means every note is a bullet point (called a Block). It is also networked, meaning notes are connected via links rather than stacked in folders.

### Key Features at a Glance
    * Local Ownership: Your data lives on your computer as simple text files (.md).
    * The Journal: The default daily landing page.
    * Bi-directional Linking: Connecting page A to page B automatically links B back to A.

## 2. The Interface: Your Daily Workspace

    * When you open Logseq, you aren't greeted by a blank file structure. You are greeted by **The Journals**.

    ### The Journals Page
Think of this as your daily scratchpad or "inbox." Every day, Logseq creates a new page with today's date.

    * Don't worry about where to put a note. Just write it on today's Journal page.
    * Indent to organize. Use the Tab key to nest thoughts under a parent block.

## 3. How to Use Logseq (The Basics)
### A. Writing in Blocks
Everything in Logseq is a "Block."

    * Type your thought.
    * Press Enter to create a new block.
    * Press Tab to indent (create a child block) or Shift + Tab to un-indent.

### B. The Magic of Linking [[ ]]
This is the most important feature. If you are writing about a meeting with a client, do not just type the name. __Link it__.

    - How to do it: Type two square brackets [[ and type the name of the topic, person, or project.
    - Example: "Had a great call with [[John Smith]] regarding the [[Marketing Project]]."

Why do this? If you click on the [[Marketing Project]] page later, you will see every single time you mentioned that project in your daily Journals, automatically collected for you. This is called a Backlink.

### C. Task Management
You can track to-dos directly in your notes without switching apps.

    - Create a Task: Type TODO or LATER at the start of a block.
    - Complete a Task: Click the checkbox or change the text to DONE.

## 4. A Simple Day-One Workflow
If you are unsure how to start, follow this loop:

    * Open Logseq to the Journals page.
    * Capture: specific items as they happen.
        - Example: "9:00 AM - Started research for [[History Essay]]."
    * Link: Create a page for the topic.
        - Action: Click [[History Essay]].
    * Refine: Inside the new page, add specific permanent notes, images, or PDFs related to that essay.
    * Review: At the end of the week, look at your Graph View (click "Graph View" in the sidebar) to see how your constellations of thoughts are growing.

## 5. Why Logseq Wins on Privacy
Unlike cloud-based tools (like Notion or Roam Research), Logseq reads files directly from your hard drive.

    * You own your data. If Logseq disappears tomorrow, you still have all your notes as readable text files.
    * It works offline. No internet connection is required.

## Summary Checklist for Beginners

-[ ] Choose a folder on your computer to store your "Graph" (your notes).
