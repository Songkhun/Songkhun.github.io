About me
======
I am currently a Lecturer and Head of the Geoscience Division at Mahidol University, Kanchanaburi Campus, Thailand. 
I teach courses in Geophysics and Computer Programming. During my Master’s degree, I developed a forward modeling and inversion program for Direct Current (DC) Resistivity data by using MATLAB, resulting in a publication (Boonchaisuk et al., 2008). 
For my Ph.D., I led a survey team to study the crustal structure of Kanchanaburi Province using magnetotelluric and receiver function techniques, leading to Thailand’s first publication in this field (Boonchaisuk et al., 2013). 
My work involved installing seismic stations, data acquisition, data processing, and inversion, which marked the beginning of my interest in seismology. 

After graduation, I contributed to the study of Thailand’s crustal properties and thickness using receiver function analysis (Noisagool et al., 2014). Following the largest earthquake in Thai history on May 5, 2014, I was involved in conducting a magnetotelluric survey and proposed a model related to the earthquake’s cause (Boonchaisuk et al., 2017). 

Currently, our research group plans to apply a variety of geophysical techniques to better understand subsurface structures and active faults. 

Getting started
======
I am particularly interested in the application of machine learning to geophysics and geology. Although I am relatively new to machine learning, I have recently developed and taught an Introduction to Python course for our students. In the near future, I plan to expand this into a series of courses in computer simulation and Intro duction to data science, aiming to establish a Data Science major for Geoscience students and other divisions at our campus
