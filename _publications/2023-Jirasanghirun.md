 Sinkholes are one type of geological hazard particularly in karst terrain. The two-dimensional Electrical Resistivity Tomography were used to discover a subsurface cavities at Mahaxay District, Khammouane Province, Lao PDR. The 2D cross section models of 9 survey lines were inverted using the RES2DINV program Furthermore, RES2DMOD Program is used to investigate and test cavities of various sizes, forms, depths and connectivity. Some water-filled cavities were identified. The stable and unstable cavities were classified by using L=17 ×d from Waltham et al. (2005) . The 4 unstable area were reported as the possible areas of future subsidence.
