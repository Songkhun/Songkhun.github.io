I receiving a research grant from the Ministry of Science and ICT of the Republic of Korea to participate in the Scientist Invitation Program to Korea 2025 (SIP 2025), organized by INITHiNK, a research and development (R&D) consulting company.
The program took place from July 1 to September 26, 2025, in Seoul and Daejeon, Republic of Korea, and brought together 35 invited scientists from five APEC member economies: Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Peru, and Vietnam. It aims to promote knowledge exchange, foster collaborative research, and expand international academic networks.

During the program, I collaborated with Dr. Seong Kon Lee, Principal Investigator at the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources (KIGAM), conducting research on machine learning for soil classification and geotechnical data analysis.

This achievement reflects Mahidol University, Kanchanaburi Campus’s strong commitment to global academic collaboration and advancing cutting-edge research for the future.
