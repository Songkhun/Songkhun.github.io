The earner of this badge completed an approximately 20-hour fully online course introducing scientific computing and data visualization with Generic Mapping Tools (GMT) 6, within the context of seismology and geodesy. Participants worked in a UNIX environment using shell scripting to automate tasks and create publication-quality figures. They developed core skills in plotting symbols, vectors, and gridded data, and learned to access and integrate publicly available geophysical datasets.
